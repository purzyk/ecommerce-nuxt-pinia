          </p>
          <p class="termsCopy">As software developers, we
            engineer the infrastructure of the 21st century. We recognize that our infrastructure has great power to
            shape the world and the lives of those we share it with, and we choose to consciously take responsibility
            for the social and environmental impacts of what we build.</p>
          <p class="termsCopy">We envisage a world free from
            injustice, inequality, and the reckless destruction of lives and our planet. We reject slavery in all its
            forms, whether by force, indebtedness, or by algorithms that hack human vulnerabilities. We seek a world
            where humankind is at peace with our neighbors, nature, and ourselves. We want our work to enrich the
            physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of all society.</p>
          <p class="termsCopy">We build software to further
            this vision of a just world, or at the very least, to not put that vision further from reach.</p>
